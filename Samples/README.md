# Read Me

There some InDesign scripts, which demonstrate some basic programming steps to work with InDesign and JavaScript.


Currently, detail documentation about these script (and their calling libraries) are missing.

Hope I have time to write one.

## Tested

The scripts have been tested on:

* Windows 11 + InDesign 2022 (64-bit)
* mac mini Late 2012 + masOS 10.14.7 + InDesign 2021 (32 bit)
* mac mini Late 2012 + masOS 10.15.6 + InDesign 2022 (64 bit)

with Visual Studio Code

They shall work also with ExtendScript Toolkit, with which, I did not run them all for testing.
