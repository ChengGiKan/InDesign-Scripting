# Read Me

In this folder, the script "01 Create Document.jsx" has the entry point.

Two json files are samples (working) for the script to create a InDesign document on Windows or Mac.

Please choose the right on to work on your device.



Currently, detail documentation about this script (and its calling libraries) are missing.

Hope I have time to write one.

## Tested

The script has been tested on:

* Windows 11 + InDesign 2022 (64-bit)
* mac mini Late 2012 + masOS 10.14.7 + InDesign 2021 (32 bit)
* mac mini Late 2012 + masOS 10.15.6 + InDesign 2022 (64 bit)

with Visual Studio Code.

It works also with ExtendScript Toolkit.
