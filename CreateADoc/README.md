In this folder, the script "01 Create Document.jsx" has the entry point.

Two json files are samples (working) for the script to create a InDesign document on Windows or Mac.

Please choose the right on to work on your device.



Currently, detail documentation about this script (and its calling libraries) are missing.

Hope I have time to write one.
